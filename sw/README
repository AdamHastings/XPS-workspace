DUT_MB_V4LX60_TEST SOFTWARE README
==================================

<TODO> Update this information with your own design.

The software for the UART Test includes a Board Support Package (BSP)
that is based on the Hardware (../hw) and a Test Application
(test_app) that prints the obligatory "hello world" message.  This is
specifically for the MicroBlaze and the Virtex4 LX60 FPGA.  For these
to work it requires that the SDK XML be created in the ../hw
directory, if it does not exist, it will call the required Makefile
command in the ../hw directory before building.

Directory
=========
* Makefile         - build and clean software projects
* standalone_bsp_0 - directory for the MicroBlaze Board Support Package
* test_app         - directory for the Test Application
