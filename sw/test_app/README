TEST_APP SOFTWARE README
========================

<TODO> Update this information with your own design.

This application prints the obligatory "hello world" message.  This
also includes a custom PCORE that can be used to interact with the PUF
Power Board to request and release access to the Power Board's
UART/Minicom, accept a soft reset from the PUF Board, and also gives
the DUT a way to notify the Power Board if it is done running its
test(s).

Current Version
===============

The current version of this design is: 1.0

Both the Hardware (specified in the pcores/control_core_v1_00_a)
and the Software should match this version.  If not, then
check the logs and see which is out of date.
